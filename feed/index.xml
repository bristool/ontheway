										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood&#8217;s striking actors fear that artificial intelligence is coming for their jobs &#8212; but for many stunt performers, that dystopian danger is already a reality.</p>
<p>From ‘Game of Thrones’ to the latest Marvel superhero movies, cost-slashing studios have long used computer-generated background figures to reduce the number of actors needed for battle scenes.</p>
<p>Now, the rise of AI means cheaper and more powerful techniques are being explored to create highly elaborate action sequences such as car chases and shootouts &#8212; without those pesky (and expensive) humans.</p>
<p>Stunt work, a time-honored Hollywood tradition that has spanned from silent epics through to Tom Cruise&#8217;s latest ‘Mission Impossible’, is at risk of rapidly shrinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology is exponentially getting faster and better,&#8221; said Freddy Bouciegues, stunt coordinator for movies like ‘Free Guy’ and ‘Terminator: Dark Fate’. &#8220;It&#8217;s really a scary time right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studios are already requiring stunt and background performers to take part in high-tech 3D &#8220;body scans&#8221; on set, often without explaining how or when the images will be used.</p>
<p>Advancements in AI mean these likenesses could be used to create detailed, eerily realistic &#8220;digital replicas,&#8221; which can perform any action or speak any dialogue its creators wish.</p>
<p>Bouciegues fears producers could use these virtual avatars to replace &#8220;nondescript&#8221; stunt performers &#8212; such as those playing pedestrians leaping out of the way of a car chase.</p>
<p>&#8220;There could be a world where they said, &#8216;No, we don&#8217;t want to bring these 10 guys in&#8230; we&#8217;ll just add them in later via effects and AI. Now those guys are out of the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>But according to director Neill Blomkamp, whose new film &#8220;Gran Turismo&#8221; hits theaters 25 August, even that scenario only scratches the surface.</p>
<p>The role AI will soon play in generating images from scratch is &#8220;hard to compute,&#8221; he told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gran Turismo&#8221; primarily uses stunt performers driving real cars on actual racetracks, with some computer-generated effects added on top for one particularly complex and dangerous scene.</p>
<p>But Blomkamp predicts that, in as soon as six or 12 months, AI will reach a point where it can generate photo-realistic footage like high-speed crashes based on a director&#8217;s instructions alone.</p>
<p>At that point, &#8220;you take all of your CG (computer graphics) and VFX (visual effects) computers and throw them out the window, and you get rid of stunts, and you get rid of cameras, and you don&#8217;t go to the racetrack,&#8221; he told AFP. &#8220;It&#8217;s that different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The human element<br />
The lack of guarantees over the future use of AI is one of the major factors at stake in the ongoing strike by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and Hollywood&#8217;s writers, who have been on the picket lines 100 days.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA last month warned that studios intend to create realistic digital replicas of performers, to use &#8220;for the rest of eternity, in any project they want&#8221; &#8212; all for the payment of one day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>The studios dispute this, and say they have offered rules including informed consent and compensation.</p>
<p>But as well as the potential implications for thousands of lost jobs, Bouciegues warns that no matter how good the technology has become, &#8220;the audience can still tell&#8221; when the wool is being pulled over their eyes by computer-generated VFX.</p>
<p>Even if AI can perfectly replicate a battle, explosion or crash, it cannot supplant the human element that is vital to any successful action film, he said, pointing to Cruise&#8217;s recent ‘Top Gun’ and ‘Mission Impossible’ sequels.</p>
<p>&#8220;He uses real stunt people, and he does real stunts, and you can see it on the screen. For me, I feel like it subconsciously affects the viewer,&#8221; said Bouciegues.</p>
<p>Current AI technology still gives &#8220;slightly unpredictable results,&#8221; agreed Blomkamp, who began his career in VFX, and directed Oscar-nominated &#8220;District 9.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s coming&#8230; It&#8217;s going to fundamentally change society, let alone Hollywood. The world is going to be different.&#8221;</p>
<p>For stunt workers like Bouciegues, the best outcome now is to blend the use of human performers with VFX and AI to pull off sequences that would be too dangerous with old-fashioned techniques alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this job will ever just cease to be,&#8221; said Bouciegues, of stunt work. &#8220;It just definitely is going to get smaller and more precise.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even that is a sobering reality for stunt performers who are currently standing on picket lines outside Hollywood studios.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every stunt guy is the alpha male type, and everybody wants to say, &#8216;Oh, we&#8217;re good’,&#8221; said Bouciegues. &#8220;But I personally have spoken to a lot of people that are freaked out and nervous.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France international Ousmane Dembele has signed a five-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona, the Ligue 1 champions announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Dembele, who was part of France’s 2018 World Cup-winning squad, joined Barcelona in 2017 from Borussia Dortmund and had extended his contract last year until 2024.</p>
<p>PSG took advantage of the player’s €50 million ($54 million) release clause to sign the former Rennes forward.</p>
<p>“I’m very happy to join Paris Saint-Germain and can’t wait to play in my new colours,” Dembele said in a PSG statement.</p>
<p>“I hope to continue to grow here and make all who love the club proud.”</p>
<p>Dembele, who has 37 caps for France and scored four goals, joins three other World Cup winners at PSG – Kylian Mbappé, Presnel Kimpembe and Lucas Hernandez.</p>
<p>He is the club’s ninth summer signing after defenders Milan Skriniar and Lucas Hernandez, midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Cher Ndour, forwards Marco Asensio, Lee Kang-in and Goncalo Ramos and goalkeeper Arnau Tenas.</p>
<p>At Barcelona, despite early problems adjusting to the Catalan side and injuries, Dembele scored 40 goals in 185 matches, winning three league titles in 2018, 2019 and 2023 and two Spanish Cups 2018 and 2021.</p>
<p>PSG are bolstering their attacking options with the futures of stars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar still uncertain.</p>
<p>“The passion and determination shown by Ousmane when he joined PSG is fantastic and is the attitude required for all our players,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi.</p>
<p>“We are proud to have another French World Cup winner in Paris Saint-Germain at the moment. to enter a new great era for our club.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A security alert Saturday prompted the evacuation of three floors of the Eiffel Tower in central Paris, France&#8217;s most emblematic symbol which drew 6.2 million visitors last year.</p>
<p>SETE, the body which runs the site, said bomb disposal experts as well as police were scouring the area, including a restaurant located on one of the floors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a usual procedure in this kind of situation which however is rare,&#8221; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Visitors were evacuated from both the three floors and the square under the monument shortly after 1:30 pm (1130 GMT).</p>
<p>Construction work on the tower began in January 1887 and was finished on March 31, 1889. It received two million visitors during the World&#8217;s Fair of 1889.</p>
